## Brief
To Build a static (front-end only) website, using the technologies learned throughout User Centric Frontend Development module. 
As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper).

## Guidelines
1. Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas.
2. Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
3. Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
4. Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers.
5. We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
6. The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
7. You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your website’s functionality works well.
8. Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfils. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
9. Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
10. Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.


## UX Strategy - Why does this site exist?

### Business Objectives
The main aim of the website is to generate paying clients for the shamanic energy healing practitioner, who is starting a new business. 
The website acts as a portal, introducing the potential client to this mode of energy healing, explaining the principles and benefits with text, pictures, diagrams and videos. 
It describes the practitioner’s background and training, as well as giving client testimonials, to demonstrate the practitioner’s credibility in doing this work. 
Potential clients can contact the shamanic energy healing for more information and to book a session, by using the contact details either in the footer or on the contact page. 

1.	Generate paying clients for the shamanic energy healing practitioner.

2.	Create a brand

3.	Establish credibility of shamanic energy healing practitioner:
    * Describes practitioner’s background
    * Describes practitioner’s training
    * Client testimonials
    * Photos relating to training and experience.
    * Links to Facebook page and LinkedIn.

3.	Educate and inform potential clients about shamanic energy healing.
    * Explanations in text
    * Diagrams/Pictures
    * Videos
    * FAQs

4.	Enable the potential client to contact the practitioner either for more information or to book a session. Via:
    * Contact form on contact page
    * Contact button in footer
    * Skype, Facebook, LinkedIn

### What the users of the site want
The users of this site:
1. are looking for a Shamanic energy healer to book a session.
2. are checking the credentials of the shamanic energy healer with a view to booking a session.
3. are looking for the price of a session.
3. came across the site via an internet search and want to learn more.

### Audience
The site is targeted at English speaking clients who are open to this type of healing and looking to find a shamanic energy healer via the internet. 
In this area of energy healing, clients tend to find their practitioners through word of mouth recommendations, then look for the site online to check details and make contact. 

The age of the audience can vary but tends towards a mature type of client. There are more women looking for this type of energy healing than men. 
The user may be a computer novice. 

This information is based on the shamanic energy healer’s own experience and that of their fellow practitioners. 
The physical location of the practitioner is not an issue, as many types of session can be carried out remotely via the phone or skype as well as by face to face sessions.

### Research
Talked to fellow shamanic practitioners. 
Looked at competitors’ websites to see how they were marketing themselves and the quality of their websites. 
Some of these websites were very old, missing favicons, non-responsive, poorly designed, too much text or text unreadable over background pictures,
terrible choices of colour schemes, that would give you a headache, and poorly cropped/focused pictures which did not relate to the text. 


### Potential Client Scenarios:

- Recommended, potential client looking to make contact to book a shamanic energy healing session

- Potential client searching for a shamanic energy healer via the internet and wanting to check the credentials of the shamanic practitioner i.e. be inspired with confidence to use this person’s services over another practitioners.

- Someone searching on the internet about shamanism and related information, who lands on this site and then decides to book a shamanic energy healing session.

- Returning client looking for contact details or other information.


The website is informative to any user coming to the site wanting to know more about shamanic energy healing. 
‘Shaman’ is in the name of the website and along with other keywords in the site 
i.e. “shaman, shamanic, shamanic healer, energy healing, healer, Inca shamanism, Q'ero, Qero”, so search engines will pick up on these too. 
These types of visitors could also become clients.

### The design goals of the website are that:

- the site is developed using the mobile-first approach to ensure users on all devices have a good user-experience when visiting the site. The site has been tested as new elements and formatting have been added, as well as final stage testing, to ensure this is achieved.
- the site is both engaging and inspiring keeping potential clients on the site. 
- that the site has good quality images and a simplistic uncluttered feel to it, which allows users to easily focus on the content.
- it informs and educates the site visitor, so they gain a better understanding of shamanism and are more likely to book a session.
- the client is not overwhelmed with information yet can find what they need easily from the navigation bar and accordion sections.
- the site is intuitive and user friendly.
- the use of colourful visual elements and inspiring articles is directing the potential client to contact the shamanic practitioner. 
- the images help tell the story that is in the articles and any text on the pictures is clear and easy to read.

### Strategy Trade-off
Needs writing up with **B2C**
**table and graph**

## UX Scope - What are we doing to achieve the goals set in strategy plane?

### Supporting the Business Objectives
To support the business objective the following elements, need to be included in the website:

- **Create trust** by establishing credentials of the shamanic practitioner and inspiring confidence in the potential clients, so they book a session:
    * Why someone might benefit from a shamanic-healing session?
    * Explanation of shamanic energy healing, including video
    * What the client might expect from a shamanic energy healing session
    * About the shamanic energy healing practitioner, including their training and experience
    * Testimonials
    * Gallery of photos showing the practitioner in training and other shamanic related photos.
- **Rates** – pricing and FAQs
- **Contact** - Contact Form with privacy statement.

#### Contact page 

- Hero Image with Jumbotron text and CTA – To get attention and keep a consistent feel across all the website pages.

- Contact form requesting clients name, email, telephone number and message. Each field must be validated before user can send using the ‘send button’

### Features tried and taken off site because did not look good and/or work with the design concepts.

- I tried initially to have a navbar-brand with a separate image and descriptive text written in the html element but experienced issues with the text wrapping under the image. Not a good visual image for users. So, I developed a logo which included text. This looked better.
- I wanted to draw the visitor into the site with call to action buttons on a carousel, with 4-5 images in the slideshow, on the home page. I set this up and asked some sample users to test and they said they found the carousel distracting and annoying. I looked on the internet and found many articles stating that research showed that carousels did not work very well. Users did not read them. So, I decided to remove the carousel. 
    This left me wondering the best way to get users stay on website and find/look for more information. 
- I wanted a search bar on the site so that visitors could search for a specific topic or word, but the functionality of that is beyond the scope of this project. In the absence I decided to setup dropdown items on four of the pages' menus. This looked quite messy especially on small screens. 

[[Dropdowns screenshot](https://helensayer.github.io/the-shamans-cat/assets/images/dropdowns.pdf)]

- I then thought I would make a site directory to allow users to see the major topics covered by the website. I did this by creating a blank nav-item and listing all the articles as dropdown items. 
    I linked all the dropdown items with ids to the articles, installed smooth scroll and scrollspy to show the user where they were on the navigation. I also did not show it on small devices as it took up too much of the screen. My mentor was concerned that the user would not know what page they were on.
    So, I removed it and went back to a simple nav-item with no dropdowns.

- Blog/newsletter with sign-up
- Membership with login for existing clients
- Online-booking of sessions for members
- Online Payment for sessions at point of booking
- Shop selling related books via links to Amazon

## Surface Plane

## Technologies Used

The following languages, frameworks and tools were used in the development of this site. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap provided the basic code for the site. Bootstrap classes were used as much as possible to save on writing new code in CSS.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [**Cloud9**](https://c9.io/login) is an online Integrated Development Environment IDE to be replaced by AWS Cloud 9 IDE 30th June 2019. Used as recommended by Code Institute. It provides a standardised environment for development.

- [**AWS Cloud 9 IDE**](https://www.awseducate.com/signin/SiteLogin) Used as recommended by Code Institute. It provides a standardised environment for development.

- [**HTML**](https://www.w3.org/html/) Hypertext Markup Language is a declarative programming language, used to provide structural elements to web pages.

- [**CSS**](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) is a declarative cascading style sheet programming language. Used to provide styling to html elements on a webpage.

- [**BOOTSTRAP Framework**](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free, popular, opensource, CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It contains CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components. Used to help standardise and speed up development. Also provides features I am not yet skilled to create using JavaScript.

- [**FontAwsome**](https://fontawesome.com/start) is a font and icon toolkit which adds extra icons to enhance the appearance of the website.

- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) is a library of free licensed fonts. Adds fonts to enhance the website and customize it from the standard bootstrap fonts.

- [**Popper.js**](https://popper.js.org/) is a positioning engine; its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element. This is used by Bootstrap to produce Dropdowns for displaying and positioning i.e. navbar dropdown menus 

- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com/) is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is used by Bootstrap to reference JavaScript used by the navbar.

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. The history of this website's development can be found in the Git log on my GitHub repository.

### Tools used
- [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) To generate a favicon appropriate to follow the branding of the site.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) To validate HTML code. Used throughout development and to do final checks before project submission.
- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) To validate CSS code. Used throughout development and to do final checks before project submission.
- [**AutoPrefixer**](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) is a PostCSS plugin which parses your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to ensure css code works in different browsers.
- [PhotoShop Elements](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-premiere-elements.html) used to resize, and prepare images for the web.
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress image files to reduce their size which in turn reduces the images load time on the webpage.


## Testing

Whist developing the site, I have periodically run the code through the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for errors, mainly typos. I find this helps as mistakes might affect when adding new elements.


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

### Code
- I have used code and ideas for coding from the previous mini-projects completed with the Code Institute.
- I have used code snippets from Bootstrap for features such as cards, navbar, iframe, accordion and modified them as required.
- Bootstrap css hides portion of container below navbar navbar-fixed-top [Stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14735274/bootstrap-css-hides-portion-of-container-below-navbar-navbar-fixed-top)
- I have used a code snippet from slack by Simen Daehlin to style videos in my style.css. I have noted this in the style.css.
- I have used code snippet in a set of media queries to increase text sizes as bootstrap does not make text responsive. The snippet is from [teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/change-the-size-of-paragraph-text-at-different-breakpoints-in-bootstrap-4) and I have noted it in the style.css.

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from reading information on Slack, viewing fellow students' websites and searching through loads of articles and sites on the web.
- I would give particular acknowledgement to Anna Greaves, who's talks handouts and her own 1st milestone project have been a huge help and inspiration.

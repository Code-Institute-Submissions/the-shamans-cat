# [![Jaguar image](assets/images/jaguar-from-logo-no-text.gif)](https://helensayer.github.io/the-shamans-cat) **THE SHAMAN'S CAT** 

>## **Project Overview**

A Shamanic Energy Healing practitioner is starting a new business in the UK. The main aim of the website is to generate clients for the practitioner. 

The website has been designed to provide potential clients with a basic understanding of the concepts and processes involved with this modality and their benefits. The potential client can then make an informed choice to contact the practitioner and book a healing session. The material is presented in a varied format; text, videos and pictures, in order to engage the potential clients. There are multiple links on each page guiding the potential client to make contact with the practitioner. 

### **Background to Project**
This site has been developed as a static frontend site using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap, following the [Code Institute Project Guidelines.](https://helensayer.github.io/the-shamans-cat/assets/images/code-institute-guidlines-ms1.pdf) 
This is my first milestone project to demonstrate the skills I have learnt so far on the course.

>## **UX Strategy** 

**UX Strategy** = **Design Strategy** + **Business Strategy**

**UX Strategy** - _**Focus:** - (What's worth doing?)_
* The Shamanic Energy Healing Practitioner is setting up a business and is looking for clients. They need an online presence to aid this process.

**Design Strategy**	- _**Definition:** - (What are we creating?)_
* Create a custom website for the practitioner.

**Business Strategy** - _**Value:** - (What value does it provide?)_ 

**Value to Business:**
* Establish an online presence so potential clients can find the practitioner. 
* Creates a brand for the practitioner so they can be identified over the competition. 
* Increases the practitioner’s client base by inspiring confidence in the potential clients to make contact and book a session. 
* The site acts as proof of ability of the practitioner to the potential clients. 
* In addition, social media links help promote the practitioner’s online presence.

**Value to Clients:**
* Become informed about this modality and its benefits. 
* Learn about the practitioner, her experience so they can decide if the practitioner is credible.
* Find out the cost of a session and decide if it is affordable.
* Contact the practitioner for either, more information, or to book a session.

***

### **Business Goals**

*	To engage potential clients so that they contact the practitioner and book a healing session.
*	Produce a blog with regular articles to attract new clients.
*	Existing clients are able to book follow-up sessions online. (Would not want new clients to book this way as the practitioner needs to initially assess each client.)

### **B2C**
The website is a little different from a basic B2C site as the potential clients need reassurance, confidence and trust in the practitioner and the processes used during a session, to encourage them to make contact and/or book a healing session; they are not just influenced by emotion to make a quick impulse buy. They need a reasonable amount of background information in order to be able to make an informed choice about whether to have a healing session.

___

### **Audience**
The site is targeted at English speaking clients who are open to this type of healing and looking to find a shamanic energy healer. In this area of energy healing, clients tend to find their practitioners through word of mouth recommendations, then look for the site online to check details and make contact.

The age of the audience can vary but tends towards a mature type of client. There are more women looking for this type of energy healing than men. The user may be a computer novice. This information is based on the shamanic energy healer’s own experience, that of their fellow practitioners and potential users.

The website is informative to any user coming to the site wanting to know more about shamanic energy healing. 
‘Shaman’ is in the name of the website and along with other keywords in the site 
i.e. “shaman, shamanic, shamanic healer, energy healing, healer, Inca shamanism, Q'ero, Qero”, so search engines will pick up on these too. 
These types of visitors could also become clients.
___

### **Location**
The physical location of the practitioner is not an issue, as many types of session can be carried out remotely via the phone, skype and WhatsApp as well as by face to face sessions.

___

### **Research**
1. I talked to shamanic practitioners and potential clients and showed them my Ideas.

    Feedback: 
    *   I thought a carousel would be a good way of attracting clients to a section of the site they were most interested in. My research informed me that users did not like carousels and would not read most of the information. I checked this out with various web articles and found that research showed that carousels are not an effective way of promoting information or product as they get ignored by users, who get hit by banner blindness. This resulted in me not using a carousel on this website.
    * Users wanted a simple layout.

2. Looked at competitors’ websites to see how they were marketing themselves and the quality of their websites. 

* Some of these websites did not look that credible i.e.
    * looked homemade
    * old fashioned style
    * out of date information
    * missing favicons
    * non-responsive
    * poorly designed:
        * too much text or text unreadable over busy background pictures, 
        * terrible choices of colour schemes - that would give you a headache 
        * poorly cropped/focused pictures which did not relate to the text
        * difficult to find information
* On the other hand, some sites were very professional, custom made and looked very credible. These sites tend to belong to extremely successful Shamanic Practitioners who have large followings and, in some cases, give training. 
* Other sites of prominent Shaman are old-fashioned looking but due to the importance of the Shamanic Practitioner, users are more interested in the content than what the page looked like.
3. In conclusion, this website needs the right amount of relevant, interesting and inspiring content, presented in a clear way which make it easy to read and navigate through, even for computer novices, leading the visitor to make contact with the practitioner.

### **Potential Client Scenarios**

* Recommended, potential client looking to make contact to book a shamanic energy healing session

* Potential client searching for a shamanic energy healer via the internet and wanting to check the credentials of the shamanic practitioner i.e. be inspired with confidence to use this person’s services over another practitioners.

* Someone searching on the internet about shamanism and related information, who lands on this site and then decides to book a shamanic energy healing session.

* Returning client looking for contact details or other information.

___

### **Product Considerations** 
*How to rise above the competition and make this site special.*

*	Mobile First, responsive approach to accommodate all user devices and screen types.
*   Navigation is easy and intuitive.
*	A simple clean consistent appearance, bright and uncluttered with an intuitive format and informative headlines. 
*   Text is in easy to read typefaces and contrasted appropriately.
*   Images are relevant to the content.
*	Keep the content to a minimum whilst still providing the user with sufficient information for them to feel they comprehend enough of the healing processes, and pricing structure, to be able to book a session. This includes the use of descriptive text, images, diagrams, videos, FAQs, testimonials and blogs.
*	Encourage users to return to the site for reference by providing good information and explanations.
*	Facilitate easy contact with practitioner so any questions and concerns can be dealt with promptly, paving the way for the user to book a session, use of Call-To-Actions (CTAs). Multiple contact routes via social media links, as well as a contact form.

___

### **Finding this Website**
How are potential clients going to find this website?
*	Word of mouth
*	Search Engines – need to use Search Engine Optimization (SEO) e.g. research and use keywords.
*	Add to Google Business
*	Add location to Google Maps
*	Cross-links to other sites
*	Blogs and articles 
*	Join reference sites
*	Subscription to listings

### **Strategy Trade-offs**
To work out what's worth having in the initial release of the website I used the strategy trade-off matrix. 

The first four Opportunities/Problems are possible at the moment with my current skillset. The last two will need additional skills that will be covered later on in the course. So I will produce a minimum-viable-product (MVP) implementing the four highest priorities listed in the table below. Future releases will include a blog and the ability for members i.e. existing clients, to book follow-up sessions via the website.

>## **UX Scope**

The scope of the project is based on the strategy and the priorities identified in the strategy trade-offs.
Scope Includes the functional specifications and the content specifications.

### **User stories**
1.	As a first-time site visitor, I can find what I am looking for easily and find the site engaging. I can contact the practitioner to book a session or return to the site at a future date.
2.	As a site visitor, I can easily use the navigation bar to find out more details on shamanic energy healing and decide if I want to contact this practitioner.
3.	As a site visitor, I can view the credentials of this shamanic healer, and decide if I want to contact them for a session or for more information.
4.	As a recommended potential client, I can find out about the shamanic practitioner, what sessions entail, read testimonials, view the pricing and then make contact via the contact form.
5.	As a potential client looking for a shamanic energy healer, I can find out about the shamanic healer, what sessions entail, read testimonials, view pricing and can contact the practitioner via the contact form to book a session.
6.	As a returning visitor, deciding to work with the practitioner, I can find the pricing and contact details easily.
7.	As any site visitor, I can check out the practitioner on social media by clicking on the social media icons in the footer.
8.	As any site visitor I can use the contact form to contact the practitioner and/or ask for information.

### **Content Specification**

The website needs the following content to accommodate the business goals and user requirements, derived from the strategy trade-offs: 

* **Online presence**
    * Establish a brand so easily distinguishable from competition
        * Use a Jaguar image – The shaman’s cat is a jaguar. The jaguar is an Inca shamanic archetype and represents the power of transformation.
        * Logo of Jaguar silhouette
        * Favicon of Jaguar silhouette
        * Social Media links to practitioner

* **Create trust** by establishing credentials of the shamanic practitioner and inspiring confidence in the potential clients, so they book a session.

* **Content requirements:**
To provide background information, important to the user in making informed choice about how to proceed.
The content is mixed including text, diagrams, photos and videos, so this breaks up the text to some extent. Due to there being a lot of text necessary to explain the background I have used various components from Bootstrap to breakup large chunks of text to make them more interesting and readable for the user. i.e. jumbotron, collapse, accordion and modals.
    * **Content Topics:**
        * The role of the shaman in modern society.
        * Why someone might benefit from a shamanic healing session?
        * Explanation of shamanic energy healing. 
        * What the client might expect from a shamanic energy healing session.
        * About the shamanic energy healing practitioner, including their training and experience.
        * Testimonials.
        * Photos showing the practitioner in training.
* **Rates** – Pricing - is it affordable?
* **FAQs** - inform user - is this something I want to do?
* **Contact** - Contact Form - to get in touch for more information or to book a session.
* **Medical Disclaimer, Privacy Statement and copyright Info** - business rules - legal

* _**What Research indicated**_
    * **No Carousel** - as I initially thought it was a good idea but this turned out not to be a good idea as the users did not like it.
    * **Simple Navigation** To move around the site.
    * **Easy to read text**

>## **UX STRUCTURE and SKELETON**

<!-- The structure plane deals with how the information is structured and how it is logically grouped. 
- how our information is structured, 
- how it's logically grouped, the features, the elements, the data, the information. 
- Remember, a user is only visiting your site for some kind of content. They're looking for some kind of content. -->

### **Functional Specifications**
Taking on-board the information from the scope plane and the following points:

* The site is developed using the mobile-first approach to ensure users on all devices have a good user-experience when visiting the site.
* The site is intuitive, so easily learnable, making it user friendly. It uses consistent, predictable, interfaces and interactions and gives feedback where necessary e.g. if required fields not completed correctly in contact form.
* The navigation is conventional so that novice users can find their way around the site easily. So a fixed top navigation bar with logo on the left hand side and menu items aligned to the right, with text reading from left to right. A Burger menu icon on right hand side on devices with small screens.
* The site is both engaging and inspiring keeping potential clients on the site. 
* For consistency and simplicity there are only two font-families used throughout the site. These are both clear and easy to read.
* Subtle background colours are used with the text to improve its readability.
* The site has good quality images and a simplistic uncluttered feel to it, which allows users to easily focus on the content.
* The site informs and educates the site visitor, so they gain a better understanding of shamanism and are hopefully more likely to book a session.
* the client is not overwhelmed with information yet can find what they need easily from the navigation bar, modal, collapse and accordion sections.
* the use of colourful visual elements such as the contact buttons and inspiring articles are directing the potential client to contact the shamanic practitioner. 
* the images help tell the story that is in the articles and any text on the pictures is clear and easy to read.

### **Navigational Design and Hierarchy**

The content will be arranged on the site using a standard **tree structure** going down one level only. This reduces complexity as it reveals information and structure as the user navigates through the tree and keeps the number of clicks for a user, to get to a destination, to under three clicks. This tree structure can be challenging on a mobile device, but this issue is resolved by using the convention of the Burger icon. The navigation elements collapse into this single Burger icon and are revealed when you click on the icon.


![Tree Structure](assets/images/sitemap.png)

**Each page** has some identical components
*   **Header** - contains logo and menu
*   **Footer** - contains logo, contact button, social media links, Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Copyright information.
*   **Hero image** with call-to-action, which takes the user to the contact form.

**Individual pages:**
*   **Home** - Background to Shamanic Healing
*   **Shamanic Healing** - Healing systems and processes used
*   **About** - About the practitioner - training, experience, testimonials.
*   **Rates** - Pricing and FAQs
*   **Contact** - Contact form

**Navigational Elements**

* **Menu**
* **Logo** The logo can be found on the left-hand-side (LHS) of nav-bar and on the LHS of the footer. When  

* **Back-to-Top/Top**
* **Contact Buttons**
* **Social Media Icons**

I did look at adding an additional layer to the tree structure but this looked messy and confusing and took up a lot of the screen on mobile devices e.g.
![Two level tree structure](assets/images/dropdowns.png)




As there is a lot of information on the site I had wanted a search bar to help users find things more easily and , as a search bar is beyond the scope of this project. So, I thought I would make a site directory to allow users to see the major topics covered by the website. I did this by creating a blank nav-item and listing all the articles as dropdown items. I linked all the dropdown items with ids to the articles, installed smooth scroll and scrollspy to show the user where they were on the navigation. I also did not show it on small devices as it took up too much of the screen. My mentor was concerned that the user would not know what page they were on. So, I removed it and went back to a simple nav-item with no dropdowns. e.g.

![Site Directory](assets/images/img-site-directory.png)


<!-- The skeleton plane deals with how the information is represented and the user navigates to the information and what features are present. 

- How will the user navigate through the information and the features?
- How will the content relate to each other? What relationships will the content have?
- What has priority? What has top priority? What has lower priority? And based on those priorities, where do we position the content?
- How do we navigate to those higher and lower priorities?-->

>## **FEATURES**

### **Existing Features Common to Each Page**

* **Logo** – Silhouette of Jaguar with text setting the brand - on every page top-right-hand side in the navigation bar, acts as a link to the home page from any other page on the website. There is also a logo in the footer bottom right-hand-side of each page. This logo also acts as a link to the home page.

* **Navigation bar** – Fixed position at the top of the screen and reading from left to right, in a conventional manner, offering intuitive access to all pages of the website. The navigation-bar is replaced with a menu (Burger) icon, for mobile devices, which drops down over content when clicked.

* **Hero Image with Jumbotron** – Hero image with overlaid Jumbotron containing a text area to each page. Below this text area is a call-to-action (CTA) button, to contact the practitioner. The button is brightly coloured to get attention of user. Different hero image and Jumbotron text on each page, but with same format, which keeps a consistent feel across all the website pages.

* **Footer** – This is at the bottom of every page and contains:
    *   Logo - When clicked takes user back to home page.
    *   Contact button which when clicked leads to the contact form.
    *   Social media icons providing links to other social platforms used by the practitioner.
    *   A Terms & Condition's button - when clicked opens a modal, to clarify matters legally. 
    *   A Privacy Policy button - when clicked opens a modal to clarify matters legally regarding the electronic storage of personal details.
    *   Copyright for protection of business data.

 * **Back-to-Top**  -  This anchor is in the form of a purple arrow with text **Back-to-Top** beneath it. It appears towards the bottom of each page on the right-hand-side. When clicked it allows the user to go to the top of the current page. It changes name to **Top** on smaller devices, so that it takes up less screen space. The z-index has been set so that it does not show on top of the Hero image as this looked messy. The user is near the top of the page when on the Hero image anyway.

* **Favicon** - Provides continuation of cat/jaguar branding to identify this site's webpages in browser tabs.
___
### **Existing Features on individual Pages**
#### Home page 

* Hero Image of a Peruvian sacred mountain - Salkantay.
* Jumbotron text specific to Shamanic Energy Healing. The amount of text is increased on devices larger than mobiles.
* Article - What is Shamanic energy healing? 
    * Article with informative paragraphs of text. To avoid too much text on page a ‘read more’ button is used. This uses Bootstrap collapse feature.
    * A series of three short videos featuring Alberto Villoldo of The Four Winds Society describing modern shamanic healing (YouTube embedded,  NOT set to play automatically).    
    * Article - Benefits of Shamanic energy healing
    * Image of a butterfly which symbolizes transformation, which can occur with this healing modality. The image helps break up the text, and balances the screen on larger screened devices. 
    * Text outlining the benefits of this type of healing. To avoid too much text on page and overwhelming users, a ‘read more’ button is being used. This uses Bootstrap collapse feature.

#### Shamanic Healing page

* Hero Image - Theologue by the artist Alex Grey. Showing artists impression of energy in and around the body.
* Jumbotron text specific to the page - Shamanic Healing - briefly explains what the page is about.
* Article - Shamanic Healing - a more detailed look, with a video explaining some of the healing techniques used  (embedded from YouTube, NOT set to play automatically).
* Article - The Luminous Energy Field – image and text to give client a better understanding of terms and concepts used.
* Article - The Chakra System - image and text to give client a better understanding of terms and concepts used. To avoid too much text on page a ‘read more’ button is used. This uses Bootstrap collapse feature.
* Article - The Shaman's Mesa - image and text explaining what the mesa is and that it will be used in healing sessions.
* Healing Processes that can be used in a session. As there are ten processes, these were displayed using Bootstrap card-deck and modals, to break up text so it was in a better format for the user to digest. A block of standard text could have been overwhelming for the user, so this breaks it up into smaller neater sections and allows them to select the topic of interest to them. The card deck displays single column on mobile and to two columns on devices larger than mobiles. The various processes are:
    * Illumination
    * Extraction
    * Soul Retrieval
    * Ancestral Healing
    * Cord Cutting
    * Transition Rites
    * Death Rites
    * Despacho
    * Destiny Retrieval
    * Fire Ceremony

* Jumbotron text specific to the page - 
* Contact form requesting clients name, email, telephone number and message. Each field must be validated before user can send using the ‘send button’

<!-- ### Features tried and taken off site because did not look good and/or work with the design concepts.


* I wanted to draw the visitor into the site with call to action buttons on a carousel, with 4-5 images in the slideshow, on the home page. I set this up and asked some sample users to test and they said they found the carousel distracting and annoying. I looked on the internet and found many articles stating that research showed that carousels did not work very well. Users did not read them. So, I decided to remove the carousel. 
    This left me wondering the best way to get users stay on website and find/look for more information. 
* I wanted a search bar on the site so that visitors could search for a specific topic or word, but the functionality of that is beyond the scope of this project. In the absence I decided to setup dropdown items on four of the pages' menus. This looked quite messy especially on small screens. 

[Dropdowns screenshot](https://helensayer.github.io/the-shamans-cat/assets/images/dropdowns.pdf)

 --- -->

### **Features Left to Implement**

* Blog/newsletter with sign-up
* Membership with login for existing clients
* Online-booking of sessions for members

**Possible features for the future not included in initial planning**
* Search bar
* Improved privacy policy delivery
* Online Payment for sessions at point of booking
* Shop selling related books via links to Amazon

With my current skillset cannot develop these at this time and they are beyond the scope of this project.

>## **Testing**

Gitpod indicates problem as you develop code. So they can be eliminated immediately where possible. The site pages have also been tested with appropriate validators and produce no errors:
[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I write my text chunks for the site in word so they are spelling free when loaded to the website. I also have installed Code Spell Checker to avoid spelling mistakes and typos.

**Page Load Times**
Tested using Chrome DevTools:
Load times for the home page are a bit slow due to it having three embedded YouTube videos. I believe that this can be addressed with javaScript. Currently, this is beyond my skillset and the scope of this project.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### **Bugs**


**Fixed Bug:**

* **background-attachment property on iPhones**.
Chrome dev tool showed that the hero images were displaying correctly on apple mobile devices, this was not the case. I looked on a real apple mobile device (iPhone 8) and the image looked awful. It only displayed part of the background image. At first I thought it was not recognising the the background-position property in the CSS. On further investigation, reading articles in stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3183467/css-background-position-not-working-in-mobile-safari-iphone-ipad, I discovered tha it was the background-attachment property that was not being interpreted as expected, so I removed the value of 'fixed' so it would use the default which is 'scroll'. I tested this and it worked, so I changed it on all the Hero Images, which now work as expected on iPhones.

**Outstanding Bugs**
Error in console on Chrome Developer Tools.

https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592

Fix is beyond the scope of this project.

LOGO
I tried initially to have a navbar-brand with a separate image and descriptive text written in the html element but experienced issues with the text wrapping under the image. Not a good visual image for users. So, I developed a logo which included text. This looked better. However, I cannot set the logo to responsive as is only a png file and does not scale well, so used media queries to adjust size on different screen sizes. This doesn't work particularly well as in LightHouse tests in Chrome Dev Tools it looses points on best practice as logo image is not responsive. A fix might be to create the logo as a scalable vector graphic (SVG) file. This would involve either buying it from a logo maker site or investing in a tool such as Adobe Illustrator. It would then have to be the right size to fit in the Bootstrap navbar which is quite restrictive. Logos need to be well thought out and designed. Hopefully, as I gain more web development skills I will be better able to deal with logos.

### **Code**
- I have used code and ideas for coding from the previous mini-projects completed with the Code Institute.
- I have used code snippets from Bootstrap for features such as cards, navbar, iframe, accordion and modified them as required.
- Bootstrap css hides portion of container below navbar navbar-fixed-top [Stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14735274/bootstrap-css-hides-portion-of-container-below-navbar-navbar-fixed-top)
- I have used a code snippet from CI Slack by Simen Daehlin to style videos in my style.css. I have noted this in the style.css.
- I have used code snippet in a set of media queries to increase text sizes as bootstrap does not make text responsive. The snippet is from [teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/change-the-size-of-paragraph-text-at-different-breakpoints-in-bootstrap-4) and I have noted it in the style.css.
- For the favicon I have used reference to code from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48956465/favicon-standard-2019-svg-ico-png-and-dimensions)
- For aligning the the 'Read more" buttons at the bottom of the cards in the card-deck Healing Processes I based my code on an answer in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48406628/bootstrap-align-button-to-the-bottom-of-card)

### **Acknowledgements**

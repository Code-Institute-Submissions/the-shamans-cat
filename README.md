## **Project Overview**

A Shamanic Energy Healing practitioner is starting a new business in the UK. The main aim of the website is to generate clients for the practitioner. 

The website has been designed to provide potential clients with a basic understanding of the concepts and processes involved with this modality and their benefits. The potential client can then make an informed choice to contact the practitioner and book a healing session. The material is presented in a varied format; text, videos and pictures, in order to engage the potential clients. There are multiple links on each page guiding the potential client to make contact with the practitioner. 

<!-- The website has the following features: 

* **Common Features** The pages all share an easy to use navigation system, Hero Image, Call*to Action (CTA) button, logo, links to practitioner’s social media sites, terms & conditions, privacy policy and contact buttons.
 * **Homepage** – explains what Shamanic Energy Healing is, its role in our modern world, the principles behind it and its benefits.
* **Shamanic Healing** – describes in more detail about Shamanic Energy Healing, the terminology and the processes used. 
* **About** – explains the background and training of the practitioner, along with client testimonials, to establish the credibility of the practitioner doing this work.
* **Rates** – how much a session costs and FAQs.
* **Contact** – contact form. -->

### **Background to Project**
This site has been developed as a static frontend site using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap, following the [Code Institute Project Guidelines.](https://helensayer.github.io/the-shamans-cat/assets/images/code-institute-guidlines-ms1.pdf) 
This is my first milestone project to demonstrate the skills I have learnt so far on the course.

***


## **UX Strategy** 

**UX Strategy** = **Design Strategy** + **Business Strategy**

**UX Strategy** - _**Focus:** - What's worth doing?_
- The Shamanic Energy Healing Practitioner is setting up a business and is looking for clients. They need an online presence to aid this process.

**Design Strategy**	- _**Definition:** - What are we creating?_
- Create a custom website for the practitioner.

**Business Strategy** - _**Value:** - What value does it provide?_ 
- Establish an online presence so potential clients can find the practitioner. 
Creates a brand for the practitioner so they can be identified over the competition. 
Increases the practitioner’s client base by inspiring confidence in the potential clients to make contact and book a session. 
The site acts as proof of ability of the practitioner to the potential clients. 
In addition, social media links help promote the practitioner’s online presence.

**Value to Clients**
- Become informed about this modality and its benefits. 
Learn about the practitioner and her experience so they can decide if credible and want to book a session.

***

### **Business Goals**

*   To increase number of clients for practitioner.
*	To establish an online presence for the practitioner.
*	To establish a brand, synonymous with the practitioner.
*	To inform potential clients about the healing processes, through articles, pictures and videos.
*	To make potential clients aware of the training and experience of the practitioner, through testimonials and a brief outline of the practitioner’s training in this field, in order to inspire confidence in the processes and the practitioner.
*	To engage potential clients so that they contact the practitioner and book a healing session.
*	Produce a blog with regular articles to attract new clients.
*	Existing clients are able to book follow-up sessions online. 
*	To utilise User Experience Design (UXD) to ensure that potential clients encounter a positive user experience whilst visiting the site and want to follow through, by contacting the practitioner to book a session and may want to return to the site at a later time for information.

### **User Goals** 

*	To find a Shamanic Energy Healing practitioner by either arriving at the site through a word of mouth recommendation or via an online search and decide if they wish to work with the practitioner.
*	To learn more about Shamanic Energy Healing and decide if they would like to undertake this kind of healing.
*	To find out more about the practitioner and determine if they are credible to work with.
*	To be able to view the pricing structure and decide if a session is affordable.
*	To easily get in touch with the practitioner to book a healing session.
*	To be able to contact the practitioner for more information.

### **B2C**
The website is a little different from a basic B2C site as the potential clients need reassurance, confidence and trust in the practitioner and the processes used during a session, to encourage them to make contact and/or book a healing session; they are not just influenced by emotion to make a quick impulse buy. They need a reasonable amount of background information in order to be able to make an informed choice about whether to have a healing session.

### **Audience**
The site is targeted at English speaking clients who are open to this type of healing and looking to find a shamanic energy healer. In this area of energy healing, clients tend to find their practitioners through word of mouth recommendations, then look for the site online to check details and make contact.

The age of the audience can vary but tends towards a mature type of client. There are more women looking for this type of energy healing than men. The user may be a computer novice. This information is based on the shamanic energy healer’s own experience and that of their fellow practitioners. 

### **Location**
The physical location of the practitioner is not an issue, as many types of session can be carried out remotely via the phone, skype and WhatsApp as well as by face to face sessions.

### **Research**
1. I talked to shamanic practitioners and potential clients and showed them my Ideas.

    Feedback: I thought a carousel would be a good way of attracting clients to a section of the site they were most interested in. My research informed me that users did not like carousels and would not read most of the information. I checked this out with various web articles and found that research showed that carousels are not an effective way of promoting information or product as they get ignored by users, who get hit by banner blindness. This resulted in me not using a carousel on this website.

2. Looked at competitors’ websites to see how they were marketing themselves and the quality of their websites. 

* Some of these websites did not look that credible i.e.
    * looked homemade
    * old fashioned style
    * out of date information
    * missing favicons
    * non-responsive
    * poorly designed:
        * too much text or text unreadable over busy background pictures, 
        * terrible choices of colour schemes - that would give you a headache 
        * poorly cropped/focused pictures which did not relate to the text
        * difficult to find information
* On the other hand, some sites were very professional, custom made and looked very credible. These sites tend to belong to extremely successful Shamanic Practitioners who have large followings and, in some cases, give training. 
* Other sites of prominent Shaman are old-fashioned looking but due to the importance of the Shamanic Practitioner, users are more interested in the content than what the page looked like.

In conclusion, this website needs the right amount of relevant, interesting and inspiring content, presented in a clear way which make it easy to read and navigate through, even for computer novices, leading the visitor to make contact with the practitioner.


### **Product Considerations** 
*How to rise above the competition and make this site special.*

*	Mobile First, responsive approach to accommodate all user devices and screen types.
*	A simple clean consistent appearance, using only a couple of colours and two typefaces, bright and uncluttered with an intuitive format and Informative headlines. 
*	Keep the content to a minimum whilst still providing the user with sufficient information for them to feel they comprehend enough of the healing processes, and pricing structure, to be able to book a session. This includes the use of descriptive text, images, diagrams, videos, FAQs, testimonials and blogs.
*	Encourage users to return to the site for reference by providing good information and explanations.
*	Facilitate easy contact with practitioner so any questions and concerns can be dealt with promptly, paving the way for the user to book a session, use of Call-To-Actions (CTAs). Multiple contact routes via social media links, as well as a contact form.


### **How are potential clients going to find this website?**

*	Word of mouth
*	Search Engines – need to use Search Engine Optimization (SEO) e.g. research and use keywords.
*	Add to Google Business
*	Add location to Google Maps
*	Cross-links to other sites
*	Blogs and articles 
*	Join reference sites
*	Subscription to listings













USER Stories goes here???


### **Potential Client Scenarios:**

* Recommended, potential client looking to make contact to book a shamanic energy healing session

* Potential client searching for a shamanic energy healer via the internet and wanting to check the credentials of the shamanic practitioner i.e. be inspired with confidence to use this person’s services over another practitioners.

* Someone searching on the internet about shamanism and related information, who lands on this site and then decides to book a shamanic energy healing session.

* Returning client looking for contact details or other information.


The website is informative to any user coming to the site wanting to know more about shamanic energy healing. 
‘Shaman’ is in the name of the website and along with other keywords in the site 
i.e. “shaman, shamanic, shamanic healer, energy healing, healer, Inca shamanism, Q'ero, Qero”, so search engines will pick up on these too. 
These types of visitors could also become clients.

### **The design goals of the website are that:**

* the site is developed using the mobile-first approach to ensure users on all devices have a good user-experience when visiting the site. The site has been tested as new elements and formatting have been added, as well as final stage testing, to ensure this is achieved.
* the site is both engaging and inspiring keeping potential clients on the site. 
* that the site has good quality images and a simplistic uncluttered feel to it, which allows users to easily focus on the content.
* it informs and educates the site visitor, so they gain a better understanding of shamanism and are more likely to book a session.
* the client is not overwhelmed with information yet can find what they need easily from the navigation bar and accordion sections.
* the site is intuitive and user friendly.
* the use of colourful visual elements and inspiring articles is directing the potential client to contact the shamanic practitioner. 
* the images help tell the story that is in the articles and any text on the pictures is clear and easy to read.

* Contact form requesting clients name, email, telephone number and message. Each field must be validated before user can send using the ‘send button’

### Features tried and taken off site because did not look good and/or work with the design concepts.

* I tried initially to have a navbar-brand with a separate image and descriptive text written in the html element but experienced issues with the text wrapping under the image. Not a good visual image for users. So, I developed a logo which included text. This looked better.
* I wanted to draw the visitor into the site with call to action buttons on a carousel, with 4-5 images in the slideshow, on the home page. I set this up and asked some sample users to test and they said they found the carousel distracting and annoying. I looked on the internet and found many articles stating that research showed that carousels did not work very well. Users did not read them. So, I decided to remove the carousel. 
    This left me wondering the best way to get users stay on website and find/look for more information. 
* I wanted a search bar on the site so that visitors could search for a specific topic or word, but the functionality of that is beyond the scope of this project. In the absence I decided to setup dropdown items on four of the pages' menus. This looked quite messy especially on small screens. 

[Dropdowns screenshot](https://helensayer.github.io/the-shamans-cat/assets/images/dropdowns.pdf)

* I then thought I would make a site directory to allow users to see the major topics covered by the website. I did this by creating a blank nav-item and listing all the articles as dropdown items. 
    I linked all the dropdown items with ids to the articles, installed smooth scroll and scrollspy to show the user where they were on the navigation. I also did not show it on small devices as it took up too much of the screen. My mentor was concerned that the user would not know what page they were on.
    So, I removed it and went back to a simple nav-item with no dropdowns.

## **Surface Plane**

## **Technologies Used**

The following languages, frameworks and tools were used in the development of this site. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap provided the basic code for the site. Bootstrap classes were used as much as possible to save on writing new code in CSS.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

* [**Cloud9 & AWS Cloud 9**](https://www.awseducate.com/signin/SiteLogin) is an online Integrated Development Environment IDE. Used as recommended by Code Institute. It provides a standardised environment for development.

* [**Gitpod IDE**](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an online IDE used as recommended by Code Institute. It provides a standardised environment for development.

* [**CSS**](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) is a declarative cascading style sheet programming language. Used to provide styling to html elements on a webpage.

* [**BOOTSTRAP Framework**](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free, popular, opensource, CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It contains CSS and JavaScript*based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components. Used to help standardise and speed up development. Also provides features I am not yet skilled to create using JavaScript.

* [**FontAwesome**](https://fontawesome.com/start) is a font and icon toolkit which adds extra icons to enhance the appearance of the website.

* [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) is a library of free licensed fonts. Adds fonts to enhance the website and customize it from the standard bootstrap fonts.

* [**Popper.js**](https://popper.js.org/) is a positioning engine; its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element. This is used by Bootstrap to produce Dropdowns for displaying and positioning i.e. navbar dropdown menus 

* [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com/) is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is used by Bootstrap to reference JavaScript used by the navbar.

* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. The history of this website's development can be found in the Git log on my GitHub repository.

### **Tools used**
* [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) To generate a favicon appropriate to follow the branding of the site.
* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) To validate HTML code. Used throughout development and to do final checks before project submission.
* [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) To validate CSS code. Used throughout development and to do final checks before project submission.
* [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) is a PostCSS plugin which parses your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to ensure css code works in different browsers.
* [PhotoShop Elements](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-premiere-elements.html) used to resize, and prepare images for the web.
* [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress image files to reduce their size which in turn reduces the images load time on the webpage.



## **Testing**

Whist developing the site, I have periodically run the code through the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for errors, mainly typos. I find this helps as mistakes might affect when adding new elements.


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### **Bugs**

### **Code**
- I have used code and ideas for coding from the previous mini-projects completed with the Code Institute.
- I have used code snippets from Bootstrap for features such as cards, navbar, iframe, accordion and modified them as required.
- Bootstrap css hides portion of container below navbar navbar-fixed-top [Stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14735274/bootstrap-css-hides-portion-of-container-below-navbar-navbar-fixed-top)
- I have used a code snippet from CI Slack by Simen Daehlin to style videos in my style.css. I have noted this in the style.css.
- I have used code snippet in a set of media queries to increase text sizes as bootstrap does not make text responsive. The snippet is from [teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/change-the-size-of-paragraph-text-at-different-breakpoints-in-bootstrap-4) and I have noted it in the style.css.
- For the favicon I have used reference to code from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48956465/favicon-standard-2019-svg-ico-png-and-dimensions)
- For aligning the the 'Read more" buttons at the bottom of the cards in the card-deck Healing Processes I based my code on an answer in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48406628/bootstrap-align-button-to-the-bottom-of-card)

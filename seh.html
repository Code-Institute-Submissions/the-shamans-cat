                    <p>Shamans believe that the world seems real only because we perceive it as such and that everything we perceive is a reflection of an internal, individual “map” or blueprint that each of us has constructed about the nature of reality.</p>
                    <p>These maps are stored in what shamans define as the Light Body or Luminous Energy Field (LEF), and what scientists call neural networks in our brain. Many investigators believe that the Light Body is simply an aura produced by electric
                        activity in the brain and nervous system. It’s why auras can actually be photographed and sometimes seen by the naked eye. Shamans, however, believe that the Light Body is what creates and continues to mould the body, the brain,
                        and the nervous system. Shamans know that if they wish to change the outer world, they must begin by changing the inner maps, by healing the imprints of disease and trauma from the Light Body. They believe that the Light Body is
                        the blueprint that creates health or disease and that greater understanding of this Light Body process can induce self-healing. … Alberto Violldo</p>

                    <p>The Luminous Energy Field (LEF) — also called the light body, halo or aura; is a matrix that envelops and informs the physical structure of all living beings, and organizes the body the same way that iron filings are organized by a
                        magnet.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Luminous Energy Field contains an archive of all of our personal and ancestral memories, early-life trauma and wounds from former lifetimes.</p>

                    <p>These records or imprints are stored in full color and intensity of emotion. Imprints are like dormant computer programs that when activated compel us toward behaviors, relationships, accidents, and illnesses that parody the initial
                        wounding. Our personal history repeats itself. Imprints of physical trauma are stored in the outermost layer of the LEF.</p>

                    <p>Emotional imprints are stored in the second layer, soul imprints in the third, and spiritual imprints in the fourth and deepest layer. Imprints in the LEF predispose us to follow certain pathways in life; they orchestrate incidents,
                        experiences, and the people we attract to ourselves.</p>

                    <p>The LEF contains a template of how we live, how we age, how we heal, and how we might die. When there is no imprint for disease in the LEF, recovery from an illness happens at tremendous speed. By the same token, imprints can depress
                        the immune system, and it can take a long time for us to regain our health during illness. When we erase the negative imprint that caused the onset of illness, the immune system can rapidly eradicate the disease.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The Anatomy of The Soul</h3>
                    <p>Regardless of where we are born, everyone has a skeleton with the exact same number of bones. In the same way, we all share the same luminous anatomy, which includes the chakras and acupuncture meridians. The chakras are swirling disks
                        of energy. They spin three to four inches outside the body and link to our spine and central nervous system acting as a direct pipeline to the human neural network. They rotate clockwise, in the same direction that the spiral arms
                        of the galaxy revolve. Each chakra has a unique frequency that we perceive as one of the seven colors of the rainbow. The chakras in a newborn child display their pure color, from red in the first chakra to violet in the seventh.
                        As we grow older the colors become dull. Trauma and loss leave their toxic residues behind, and the sludge that adheres to a chakra does not permit it to vibrate at its pure frequency, and physical aging is accelerated. When a
                        shaman completes her healing process her chakras become clear. They spin freely and vibrate with their original purity again.</p>

                    <p>When you clear all of your chakras you acquire a “rainbow body.” Each center vibrates at its natural frequency, and you radiate the seven colors of the rainbow. According to legend, when you acquire the rainbow body you can make the
                        journey beyond death to the Spirit world. You are able to assist others in their healing, and you can die consciously since you already know the way back home. The jungle shamans believe death is a great predator that stalks each
                        and every one of us. When your chakras are clear you are no longer stalked by death, you are claimed by life.</p>

                    <h6>Earth Chakras</h6>
                    <p>The five lower chakras, from the root to the throat, are nourished primarily by the Earth. The four upper chakras are fed by the energies of the Sun.</p>

                            <p>The sky-god religions emphasize the development of the upper chakras to the neglect of the lower. The sky-god civilizations perfected technology, reason, and logic. The Earth-goddess religions emphasize the lower chakras to
                                the neglect of the upper ones. These civilizations remained agrarian cultures with little interest in Western-style progress. Today we must develop the gifts of both the earth chakras and the sky chakras.</p>

                            <p>Like the organs in the body, each chakra performs a unique function. The first and second chakras digest emotional energies, churning them over to draw out nutrients. When sludge builds in our second chakra (where the fight-or-flight
                                response resides) we interpret the world as hostile and aggressive. The solar plexus, heart, and throat chakras (third, fourth, and fifth) are nurtured by the finer energies of love, compassion, and empathy. They are not
                                equipped to digest emotions of any kind.</p>
                        </div>

                    <h6>Sky Chakras</h6>
                    <p>In the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth chakras, development becomes transpersonal. We explore increasingly subtle domains.</p>

                            <p>When the sixth chakra is malfunctioning, the individual confuses information with knowledge. He feels he has attained great spiritual truths, when all he has is a collection of facts. Spiritual materialism is an endemic dysfunction
                                of the third-eye chakra.</p>

                            <p>An awakened third eye gives you knowledge of the past and future and allows you to envision alternative destinies.</p>

                            <p>The seventh chakra at the very top of the head is our portal to the Heavens, in the same way that the first chakra is the portal to the Earth. The lesson of the seventh chakra is mastery of time. Whereas in the sixth chakra
                                the healer acquires knowledge of past and future events, when we awaken the gifts of the seventh chakra we are able to influence those events.</p>

                            <p>The negative expression of the seventh chakra is spiritual regression masquerading as enlightenment.</p>

                            <p>The eighth chakra resides a few inches above the head, and when awakened shines like a radiant sun inside the LEF.</p>

                            <p>The eighth chakra acts as the blueprint to create the physical body. This chakra is like a carpenter who builds a chair (the physical body) and later burns it in his fireplace. The carpenter feels no loss, as he knows that
                                he can simply build another out of new wood. The eighth chakra is unaffected by the death of the body.</p>

                            <p>In this center we become aware of the Beholder -known in Buddhism as the Witness- a self that has been present from the beginning of our spiritual journey. Now disengaged from the mind, it is able to behold the mind with all
                                of its dramas without subscribing to them. The Beholder witnesses our life unfolding, and understands that all of the stories we use to describe ourselves are only stories. The Beholder perceives everything but cannot itself
                                be perceived, because it cannot be turned into an object of perception.</p>

                            <p>The eighth chakra resides within the Luminous Energy Field. It hovers above the head like a spinning sun. It is our connection with the Great Spirit, the place where God dwells within us.</p>

                            <p>Eventually, the Beholder will begin to reveal its own source, which is Spirit, or the ninth chakra, which resides outside the Luminous Energy Field and extends throughout the cosmos. It is the heart of the universe, at one
                                with the Great Spirit. As the eighth chakra is where God dwells within us, the ninth chakra is the part of us that dwells within the Creator.</p>

                            <p>The eighth chakra corresponds to the Christian concept of the soul, which is personal and finite. The ninth chakra corresponds to Spirit, which is impersonal and infinite.</p>

                            <p>The ninth chakra resides at the heart of the Universe, it is outside time and space – the Self that has never been born and will never die. This Self is prior to time, and it never enters the river through which time flows.
                                This is the self that never left the Garden of Eden.</p>

                                <p>The Illumination Process brings us back into balance, into what Inka shamans call ayni, or proper relationship, with jaguars, microbes, and all life, so that the Universe again can work on our behalf.</p>

                                    <li>It burns up the sludge and deposits adhering to the walls of a chakra.</li>
                                    <li>This promotes longevity and strengthens the immune response. It combusts the toxic energy around malignant physical and emotional imprints. This is the fuel that an imprint employs to express itself.</li>
                                    <li>It scours clean the imprints in the Luminous Energy Field.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p></p>The Illumination Process brings about healing at the source, at the blueprint level of our being. When the chakra is cleansed and the imprints are erased, one can readily change negative emotions and behaviors. The
                                power of the immune system is unleashed, so that physical healing is accelerated.</p>

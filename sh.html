                        <p>Shamans believe that the world seems real only because we perceive it as such and that everything we perceive is a reflection of an internal, individual “map” or blueprint that each of us has constructed about the nature of reality.</p>
                        <p>These maps are stored in what shamans define as the Light Body or Luminous Energy Field (LEF), and what scientists call neural networks in our brain. Many investigators believe that the Light Body is simply an aura produced by
                            electric activity in the brain and nervous system. It’s why auras can actually be photographed and sometimes seen by the naked eye. Shamans, however, believe that the Light Body is what creates and continues to mould the body,
                            the brain, and the nervous system. Shamans know that if they wish to change the outer world, they must begin by changing the inner maps, by healing the imprints of disease and trauma from the Light Body. They believe that the
                            Light Body is the blueprint that creates health or disease and that greater understanding of this Light Body process can induce self-healing.</p>

                    <p>The Luminous Energy Field (LEF) — also called the light body, halo or aura; is a matrix that envelops and informs the physical structure of all living beings, and organizes the body the same way that iron filings are organized by a
                        magnet.</p>
                    <p>The Luminous Energy Field contains an archive of all of our personal and ancestral memories, early-life trauma and wounds from former lifetimes.</p>
                    <p>These records or imprints are stored in full color and intensity of emotion. Imprints are like dormant computer programs that when activated compel us toward behaviors, relationships, accidents, and illnesses that parody the initial
                        wounding. Our personal history repeats itself. Imprints of physical trauma are stored in the outermost layer of the LEF.</p>
                    <p>Emotional imprints are stored in the second layer, soul imprints in the third, and spiritual imprints in the fourth and deepest layer. Imprints in the LEF predispose us to follow certain pathways in life; they orchestrate incidents,
                        experiences, and the people we attract to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>The LEF contains a template of how we live, how we age, how we heal, and how we might die. When there is no imprint for disease in the LEF, recovery from an illness happens at tremendous speed. By the same token, imprints can depress
                        the immune system, and it can take a long time for us to regain our health during illness. When we erase the negative imprint that caused the onset of illness, the immune system can rapidly eradicate the disease.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of where we are born, everyone has a skeleton with the exact same number of bones. In the same way, we all share the same luminous anatomy, which includes the chakras and acupuncture meridians.</p>
                    <p> The chakras are swirling disks of energy. They spin three to four inches outside the body and link to our spine and central nervous system acting as a direct pipeline to the human neural network. They rotate clockwise, in the same
                        direction that the spiral arms of the galaxy revolve.</p>
                    <p>Each chakra has a unique frequency that we perceive as one of the seven colors of the rainbow. The chakras in a newborn child display their pure color, from red in the first chakra to violet in the seventh.</p>
                    <p>As we grow older the colors become dull. Trauma and loss leave their toxic residues behind, and the sludge that adheres to a chakra does not permit it to vibrate at its pure frequency, and physical aging is accelerated. When a shaman
                        completes her healing process her chakras become clear. They spin freely and vibrate with their original purity again.</p>

                    <p>When you clear all of your chakras you acquire a “rainbow body.” Each center vibrates at its natural frequency, and you radiate the seven colors of the rainbow. According to legend, when you acquire the rainbow body you can make the
                        journey beyond death to the Spirit world. You are able to assist others in their healing, and you can die consciously since you already know the way back home. The jungle shamans believe death is a great predator that stalks each
                        and every one of us. When your chakras are clear you are no longer stalked by death, you are claimed by life.</p>
                    <h6>Earth Chakras</h6>
                    <p>The five lower chakras, from the root to the throat, are nourished primarily by the Earth. The four upper chakras are fed by the energies of the Sun.</p>
                    <p>The sky-god religions emphasize the development of the upper chakras to the neglect of the lower. The sky-god civilizations perfected technology, reason, and logic. The Earth-goddess religions emphasize the lower chakras to the neglect
                        of the upper ones. These civilizations remained agrarian cultures with little interest in Western-style progress. Today we must develop the gifts of both the earth chakras and the sky chakras.</p>
                    <p>Like the organs in the body, each chakra performs a unique function. The first and second chakras digest emotional energies, churning them over to draw out nutrients. When sludge builds in our second chakra (where the fight-or-flight
                        response resides) we interpret the world as hostile and aggressive. The solar plexus, heart, and throat chakras (third, fourth, and fifth) are nurtured by the finer energies of love, compassion, and empathy. They are not equipped
                        to digest emotions of any kind.</p>

                        <p>In the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth chakras, development becomes transpersonal. We explore increasingly subtle domains.</p>

                        <p>When the sixth chakra is malfunctioning, the individual confuses information with knowledge. He feels he has attained great spiritual truths, when all he has is a collection of facts. Spiritual materialism is an endemic dysfunction
                            of the third-eye chakra.</p>

                        <p>An awakened third eye gives you knowledge of the past and future and allows you to envision alternative destinies.</p>

                        <p>The seventh chakra at the very top of the head is our portal to the Heavens, in the same way that the first chakra is the portal to the Earth. The lesson of the seventh chakra is mastery of time. Whereas in the sixth chakra the
                            healer acquires knowledge of past and future events, when we awaken the gifts of the seventh chakra we are able to influence those events.</p>

                        <p>The negative expression of the seventh chakra is spiritual regression masquerading as enlightenment.</p>

                        <p>The eighth chakra resides a few inches above the head, and when awakened shines like a radiant sun inside the LEF.</p>

                        <p>The eighth chakra acts as the blueprint to create the physical body. This chakra is like a carpenter who builds a chair (the physical body) and later burns it in his fireplace. The carpenter feels no loss, as he knows that he can
                            simply build another out of new wood. The eighth chakra is unaffected by the death of the body.</p>

                        <p>In this center we become aware of the Beholder -known in Buddhism as the Witness- a self that has been present from the beginning of our spiritual journey. Now disengaged from the mind, it is able to behold the mind with all of
                            its dramas without subscribing to them. The Beholder witnesses our life unfolding, and understands that all of the stories we use to describe ourselves are only stories. The Beholder perceives everything but cannot itself be
                            perceived, because it cannot be turned into an object of perception.</p>

                        <p>The eighth chakra resides within the Luminous Energy Field. It hovers above the head like a spinning sun. It is our connection with the Great Spirit, the place where God dwells within us.</p>

                        <p>Eventually, the Beholder will begin to reveal its own source, which is Spirit, or the ninth chakra, which resides outside the Luminous Energy Field and extends throughout the cosmos. It is the heart of the universe, at one with
                            the Great Spirit. As the eighth chakra is where God dwells within us, the ninth chakra is the part of us that dwells within the Creator.</p>

                        <p>The eighth chakra corresponds to the Christian concept of the soul, which is personal and finite. The ninth chakra corresponds to Spirit, which is impersonal and infinite.</p>

                        <p>The ninth chakra resides at the heart of the Universe, it is outside time and space – the Self that has never been born and will never die. This Self is prior to time, and it never enters the river through which time flows. This
                            is the self that never left the Garden of Eden.</p>

                    <p>The word mesa means table in Spanish but it also means high plateau, the place where the shaman goes to meet the spirits.</p>

                    <p>A shaman’s mesa is a portable altar (where he goes to meet the spirits) or medicine bundle used for healing, ceremony, prayer and divination. The contents of a mesa vary from shaman to shaman, but generally include healing stones and
                        other artifacts representing elements of their personal healing journey.</p>

                    <p>The shaman’s mesa can be found in one form or another among many native healers in the Americas. The meaning of the symbols vary from culture to culture, as do specific steps in the ceremony. However, all of the mesa rituals – whether
                        in North or South America – serve as a reminder that the forces of nature and of the human psyche can be worked with when represented as symbols and objects of power.</p>

                    <p>Students at the Light Body School earn 13 stones as they participate in rites and initiations during the course of their training. Each stone, known as a khuya, represents a wound that has been transformed into a source of wisdom and
                        courage. Later, in their own practice, they use these khuyas in energy medicine sessions for helping others.</p>
                    <p>A mesa may also contain special gifts and power objects that assist the shaman in communicating with spirits, warding off negative energies, and diagnosing ailments. All these items are wrapped in a cloth or bag (often a colorful textile
                        known as a Mastana). Many shamans carry their mesa with them wherever they go.</p>

                                                <p>These crystallized energies embed themselves in the physical body, taking on shapes such as daggers, arrows, spears, and swords. Amazon shamans believe that crystallized energies are the result of black
                                                    magic or sorcery. I have found that these energies can be caused by anger, envy, or hatred directed at us by another person—often those who are closest to us. Sometimes they are also energetic remnants
                                                    from a former existence.</p>

                                                <p>The Extraction process is performed during an Illumination, when the energetic landscapes of the chakras are revealed, and crystallized energies can be easily detected. The Illumination combusts energies
                                                    that collect around the crystallization and keep it wedged into the body, thereby facilitating the Extraction.</p>

                                                <p>Negative energies are attracted to us when there is an affinity within us. Anger can penetrate our LEF only when the vibration for anger lives within us, and hatred can affect us only when self-hatred is
                                                    present. Consequently it is not enough to extract the crystallized energies; the client’s affinities have to be changed as well. The Illumination Process heals the affinities for these energies by clearing
                                                    and stepping up the frequency at which a chakra spins. As the vibratory rate of a chakra increases, we begin to attract pure, clear, beneficent energies.</p>

                                                <p>Prior to the despacho ceremony, a variety of ingredients (biodegradable whenever possible) are gathered as offerings.

                                                <p>Suggested offerings include sugar and sweets, corn and/or other grains, coca leaves (or whatever herbs or small leaves are readily available), flowers, incense, paper (or “play”) money, salt, feathers, beans, colorful yarn, and any other item that is significant to the occasion. The elements are less important than the intent. You will also need a large piece of paper, or a sizeable leaf, to place the offerings on and later, wrap them with. Here are the steps to create your own despacho.</p>
                                                <p>The ceremony can be as simple and short, or intricate and lengthy as desired. As with any ritual, the despacho begins by opening sacred space. Then the offerings are selected one by one, a prayer is said over each, and the prayer is gently blown into the offering before it is placed on the wrapping. The offerings can be arranged however feels right. (The experienced shaman will likely follow a specific pattern, but again, the intent is more important than the pattern).</p>
                                                <p>Humility and gratitude and an open heart are important throughout the ceremony, and will ensure that you experience more grace in your life by becoming a better vessel for grace.</p>
                                                <p>Once completed, the despacho is carefully wrapped and secured with a ribbon or string. The bundle can be ceremonially buried (for slow, steady results), burned (for quicker transformation) or fed to running waters, thus conveying the gifts to Spirit.</p>
                                                <p>If the despacho is burned, someone should stay with the ﬁre until the embers are cold, if at all possible. Do not put water on the ﬁre. Ashes created in this sacred ﬁre should be buried in the earth at a later time.</p>

Shamans believe that, for each of us, there is a sacred “soul contract” that we agreed to before we were born that is the reason for our incarnation into this life. However, most of us have got so caught up with “life” that we’ve forgotten why we are really here in the first place.</p>
                                                <p>This is an elegant, guided meditation exercise to have you remember what your true calling is: whether it’s a spiritual calling, a creative calling, or a calling to be of service.</p>
                                                <p>This is an advanced shamanic journeying exercise and it is a prerequisite that you complete at least two energy clearing sessions prior to a Destiny Retrieval, as what is activated and retrieved often has a significant impact in your life. It is important you are at a point to embrace this remembering – emotionally, mentally, and energetically.</p>
